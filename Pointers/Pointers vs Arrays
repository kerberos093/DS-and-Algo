1)#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;
const int MAX = 3;
 
int main () {
   int  var[MAX] = {10, 100, 200};
 
   for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {
      *var = i;    // This is a correct syntax
      var++;       // This is incorrect.
   }
   
   return 0;
}
It is perfectly acceptable to apply the pointer operator * to var but it is illegal to modify var value. 
The reason for this is that var is a constant that points to the beginning of an array and can not be used as l-value.

------------------------------------------------
2)*(var + 2) = 500;
  Above statement is valid and will compile successfully because var is not changed.
