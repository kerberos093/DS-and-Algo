1)It is always a good practice to assign the pointer NULL to a pointer variable in case you do not have exact address to be assigned. 
This is done at the time of variable declaration. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.

2)On most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at address 0 because that memory is reserved by the 
operating system. However, the memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to point to an
accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.

3)#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  *ptr = NULL;
   cout << "The value of ptr is " << ptr ;
 
   return 0;
}
O/P-The value of ptr is 0
