1)what is oop?->programming paradigm where complete software operates as a unch of objects talking to each other
2)why oop?->overall understanding of the software is increased,eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation
3)main features->encapsulation,polymorphism,inheritance
4)encapsulatuion->data hiding,bundling of data and methods together
   polymorphism->some code or operations or objects behave differently in different contexts in c++,compile time 
                 polymorphism,run time polymorphism
   inheritance->a class is based on another class and uses data and implementation of the other class, purpose is
                 code reuse
5)abstraction->sepaeration of necessary from unnecessary details to create our own abstract view or model, hides implementaton 
               details while just presenting the features to the outside world
                eg->database system->how data is stored,created and maintained
                
6)constructors-> a special member function of class which initializes objects of the class, have same name and no return time, automati.
                 called if not written
   destructor->member function which deletes the object,called at the end of program or when delete operator is called
